// we add the three lines in object and array .
// there are two assumption:
//first:one trip in the same line. 
//second: two trips in diffrent lines and we have to change in "union square".
// if condtion (for one trip). 
// add incrementloops in the if condtion.
// else for the two lins trip.
// add decremnt loop for the backward trip.
